# Marbles-Manager

The system is designed to manage marbles using barcode scanning technology.
Marbles' barcodes are scanned by the camera, and the system supports various operations such as getting, editing, and sending the scanned data to the server. 
The data scanned is cached on the device to prevent loss in case the app is closed. 
Additionally, the system can be used in offline mode, and the data can be exported to an Excel sheet for further processing.
